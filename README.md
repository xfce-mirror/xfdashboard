# xfdashboard

Xfdashboard is maybe a Gnome shell and macOS Expose like dashboard for Xfce.

**Xfdashboard** provides a GNOME shell dashboard and macOS Mission Control
(e.g. Expos√© and Spaces) like interface for use with the Xfce desktop. It can
be configured to run with any keyboard shortcut and when executed provides an
overview of applications currently open enabling the user to switch between
different applications. The search feature works like Xfce's app finder which
makes it convenient to search for and start applications.
